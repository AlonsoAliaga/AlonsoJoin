#You can create as many formats as you want. Keep in mind they must be ordered in order to work correctly.
#The order goes from higher to lower priority. It means that if you have OP the first one is going to be used for you.
Formats:
  #This is the internal name. It doesn't matter at all, just don't use the same one.
  #Use only lowercase words and include only dashes if necessary.
  owners:
    #If permission is none or is not set it will ignore permission and will always be available.
    #If you want to set a join message for all non-ranked players create the format at the end of
    #this list and give the permission to default group/rank.
